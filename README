Prerequisites
-------------

  Mac:
    Xcode

Download the source packages
----------------------------

  Mac:
    ./get_packages_mac.sh

This will download all needed source files into the "packages" subdirectory.
Only files not already present are downloaded. If all files are present, then
this command does nothing.

Build the packages
------------------

Specify a prefix as the first argument:

  Mac:
    ./build_mac.sh /psidepsbase

You'll need write access to the prefix. The script does not use "sudo" when
performing "make install" operations, so the prefix directory may need to
exist in advance with correct permissions. Only packages not already built
will be built. If a package fails to build, this script will refuse to
continue until you fix the problem.

For each package to be built:
  1) a "build/{packagename}" directory is created as a workspace
  2) the package is attempted to be built, and installed into the prefix
  3) on success, a "build/{packagename}/ok" file is touched

The build script will only build a package if the "build/{packagename}"
directory does not exist, and it will only advance to the next package if the
directory exists and it contains an "ok" file.
