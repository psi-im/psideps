Prerequisites
-------------

  Mac:
    Xcode

  Ensure you have access to create and/or write to the /psidepsbase directory.
  All modules are configured to use a prefix within that directory, and "sudo"
  is not used when running "make install" operations. It should be enough to
  create the directory in advance with correct permissions.

Building a module
-----------------

  cd module_name
  make
 
  That's it. If all goes well, you'll end up with some .bz2 file.

How it works
------------

Only packages not already built within a module will be built when "make" is
run. If a package fails to build, the build process will refuse to continue
until you fix the problem.

For each package to be built:
  1) a "build/{package/arch name}" directory is created as a workspace
  2) the package is attempted to be built, and installed into the prefix
  3) on success, a "build/{package/arch name}/ok" file is touched

The build script will only build a package if the "build/{package/arch name}"
directory does not exist, and it will only advance to the next package if the
directory exists and it contains an "ok" file.
