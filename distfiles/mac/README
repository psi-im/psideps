This is a build of GStreamer 0.10.36 with patches for Mac 10.5+.

All library paths have been removed from the binary files. You will need to
set environment variables in order for anything to work:

  DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to lib
  GST_PLUGIN_PATH to lib/gstreamer-0.10
  GST_PLUGIN_SCANNER to libexec/gstreamer-0.10/gst-plugin-scanner

Even if you use install_name_tool to bundle the libs within an application,
you'll still need to set the GST_* variables.

If all is well, you should be able to run gst-inspect-0.10 from the bin
directory and see a big list of elements.
