This is a build of GStreamer 0.10.36 with patches for MinGW32.

You will need to set environment variables in order for anything to work:

  PATH to bin
  GST_PLUGIN_PATH to lib/gstreamer-0.10

And one of these:

  GST_PLUGIN_SCANNER to libexec/gstreamer-0.10/gst-plugin-scanner
    or
  GST_REGISTRY_FORK=no

Even if the libs are bundled within an application, you'll still need to set
the GST_* variables.

If all is well, you should be able to run gst-inspect-0.10 from the bin
directory and see a big list of elements.
