Windows 32-bit
--------------

Builds are available at qt.nokia.com, but they are not compatible with the
latest MinGW. I've experienced crashing as a result so I suggest building your
own.

Unpack Qt source into C:\Qt\{version}

From MSYS shell:

  ./configure.exe -release -qt-style-windowsxp -qt-style-windowsvista
  mingw32-make

Windows 64-bit
--------------

Unpack Qt source into C:\Qt\{version}-w64

From MSYS shell:

  export PATH=/c/mingw64/bin:$PATH
  ./configure.exe -release -qt-style-windowsxp -qt-style-windowsvista
  mingw32-make

Mac 32/64-bit universal
-----------------------

Unpack Qt source somewhere. Then:

  ./configure -release -arch x86 -arch x86_64 -sdk /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk
  make
  make install
